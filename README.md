# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection Using Deep Learning
A driver drowsiness detection system using OpenCV and CNN is a promising technology that has the potential to improve road safety by alerting drivers when they are getting drowsy or distracted. The system works by analyzing the driver\'s face and eyes to detect signs of drowsiness, such as drooping eyelids and yawning. The drowsiness detection system can be implemented in every vehicle such that we can prevent road accidents and decrease the death ratio which are caused due to drowsiness.
